# Dependency_Injection

Spring Boot Application for Dependency Injection


Description
This is a simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates Dependency Injection (DI) principles in Java. Dependency Injection is a fundamental concept in Spring, enabling loose coupling and easy management of object dependencies. This project serves as a starting point to understand and implement DI in a Spring Boot environment.

The application showcases how to configure and manage dependencies, create beans, and inject them into components. It provides practical examples of Constructor-based DI, Setter-based DI, and Interface-based DI, offering insights into different approaches to manage dependencies in Spring.

Features
Spring Boot application structure for Dependency Injection
Practical examples of Constructor, Setter, and Interface-based Dependency Injection
Customizable for adding more beans and dependency configurations
A foundation for building complex applications with proper dependency management


Usage
The application demonstrates different approaches to Dependency Injection using Spring Boot, emphasizing loose coupling and ease of testing.
Customize the application by adding your own beans, configurations, and use cases as needed.
Explore the code to understand how to create beans, inject dependencies, and manage component dependencies in Spring.
